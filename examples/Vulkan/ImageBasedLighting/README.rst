This example demonstrates Physically Based Rendering (PBR) with Image Based Lighting (IBL). 

Description
-----------
This example has two scenes using Metallic-Roughness PBR workflow

* Helmet: A GLTF model rederered  with different material properties with albedo, metallic roughness and emissive map.

* Spheres: Showcasing different metallic and non metallic materials.

IBL
---
IBL Diffuse: This is pre-computed offline from the environment map, using the lambert diffuse BRDF.
IBL Specular: The Equation split into two sums. Each sum can be pre-calculated (Pre-Filtered Environment map and Environment BRDF)

Pre-Filtered Environment map:
Pre-calculated  for different roughness values and stored in the mip-map levels of the cubemap. The environment map is convolved  with CGX distribution using important sampling. 

Evironment BRDF: This sum includes everything else, it is same as integrating the specular BRDF with solid white environment. This takes two inputs (roughness and cos Î˜v (view angle)) and two outputs (scale and bias to F0) in the range [0,1].
